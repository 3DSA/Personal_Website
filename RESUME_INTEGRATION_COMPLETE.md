## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Projects Missing Links:

If you want to add links for the missing projects, you can:

1. **Add GitHub repos** - Upload the code to GitHub and update the project with:
   ```typescript
   githubUrl: 'https://github.com/yourusername/project-name'
   ```

2. **Add video demos** - Create video demos and upload to YouTube, then update:
   ```typescript
   videoUrl: 'https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID'
   videoType: 'youtube'
   ```

3. **Add live demos** - Deploy the projects and add:
   ```typescript
   liveUrl: 'https://your-project.vercel.app'
   ```

### Where to Update:
Edit `/data/projects.ts` and add the appropriate URLs to each project.

## 🚀 Build Status

✅ **Build Successful!**
- All pages compile correctly
- No TypeScript errors
- No runtime errors
- All 8 routes generated successfully

## 📝 What to Do Next

1. **Add Project Images**
   - Create thumbnail images for your projects
   - Place them in `public/images/projects/`
   - Name them according to the slugs in projects.ts:
     - `agentic-platform-thumbnail.jpg`
     - `fracture-detection-thumbnail.jpg`
     - `fake-news-thumbnail.jpg`
     - `sp500-thumbnail.jpg`
     - `dev-journal-thumbnail.jpg`

2. **Update Resume PDF**
   - Your resume LaTeX is in the project
   - Compile it to PDF and replace `public/resume.pdf`

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000 to see your website

## 🎨 Visual Recommendations

For the best presentation of your projects without links:

1. **Fake News Detection** - Consider creating a simple demo or notebook showcase
2. **S&P 500 Prediction** - Could include accuracy graphs or prediction results
3. **DEV Journal** - Screenshots of the app would be great

You can always add these later - the website is fully functional and looks professional with the information from your resume!
