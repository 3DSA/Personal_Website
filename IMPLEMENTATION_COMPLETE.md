## 🛠 Technical Notes

### Tailwind CSS Version
We're using Tailwind CSS v3 instead of v4 for better stability and compatibility with the current Next.js ecosystem. This provides all the features you need while avoiding breaking changes.

### Video Player
The ReactPlayer component is dynamically imported to avoid SSR issues and reduce initial bundle size. It supports YouTube, Vimeo, and local video files.

### Dark Mode
Dark mode is implemented with Tailwind's `dark:` classes and persists using localStorage. The theme toggle is client-side only to avoid hydration mismatches.

### Form Handling
The contact form uses React Hook Form for form state management and Zod for schema validation. You'll need to implement the actual submission logic (e.g., send to an API route or email service).

## 🎨 Customization Tips

1. **Colors**: Edit `tailwind.config.ts` to change the color scheme
2. **Fonts**: Edit `app/layout.tsx` to change fonts
3. **Animations**: Edit `lib/constants.ts` for animation variants
4. **Styling**: Edit `styles/globals.css` for global styles
